# OCI Bundle Generator (BundleGen)
RDK Component to generate extended OCI bundle*'s from OCI Images, ready to be run by Dobby

## Environment Setup
You will need Python >=3.7 installed and configured. You will also require some project specific dependencies and OCI tools.

A Fedora 32 `Vagrantfile` is included to provide a ready-to-use environment. Otherwise follow the steps later in this document to set up your own Fedora/Ubuntu environment.

## Quick Start
Start the Vagrant VM and SSH in.
```console
$ vagrant up
$ vagrant ssh
```

Activate the Python venv
```console
$ cd ~/bundlegen
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```

Run BundleGen:

If using an image generated by the DAC SDK, then run
```console
$ bundlegen generate --platform <platform-name> <img-url> <output-dir>
```

If using an image from a generic OCI registry (not built by the DAC SDK), then run
```console
$ bundlegen generate --platform <platform-name> --appmetadata <path-to-app-metadata> <img-url> <output-dir>
```

Note the image URL should be in the form `docker://image-url`. If the image is on the Docker Hub, the full URL can be omitted - e.g `docker://hello-world`.

See the `docs` directory for more detailed documentation.

### Docker
A dockerfile is included that can be used to run BundleGen as an alternative to Vagrant. See the `docker` directory for instructions on how to use.

## Test Scripts
Test scripts are included for reference platforms to speed up the generation and installation process.

Install and test already generated bundle:
```
./test/testapp.sh 192.168.1.124 rpi-dac-image-wayland-egl-test.tar.gz
```

Generate bundle for Raspberry Pi
```
./test/build_and_test_on_rpi.sh 192.168.1.124 dac-image-wayland-egl-test.tar
```


## Development
*These steps only apply if you're not using the included Vagrantfile*

For development, you will need Python >=3.7 installed and configured. Once installed, then install project specific dependencies.

### Fedora 32
It's easier to work in Fedora as the OCI tooling is already available
```bash
# Install dependencies
sudo dnf upgrade -y
sudo dnf install -y make git skopeo go go-md2man
# Install Go
mkdir -p $HOME/go
echo 'export GOPATH=$HOME/go' >> $HOME/.bashrc
source $HOME/.bashrc
# Build/install umoci
go get -d github.com/opencontainers/umoci
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/opencontainers/umoci/
make
sudo make install
```

### Ubuntu >=18.04
It's also possible to build on Ubuntu.
Note Skopeo only publishes packages for Ubuntu 18.04 or newer. It may be possible to build skopeo from source on older distributions, see https://github.com/containers/skopeo/blob/master/install.md

```bash
# Install dependencies
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install -y make git go-md2man
# Install Go 1.13
wget https://dl.google.com/go/go1.13.12.linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar -xvf go1.13.12.linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo mv go /usr/local
mkdir -p $HOME/go
echo 'export GOPATH=$HOME/go' >> $HOME/.bashrc
echo 'export GOROOT=/usr/local/go' >> $HOME/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$GOROOT/bin:$PATH' >> $HOME/.bashrc
source $HOME/.bashrc
# Build/install umoci
go get -d github.com/opencontainers/umoci
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/opencontainers/umoci/
make
sudo make install
# Install skopeo
. /etc/os-release
sudo sh -c "echo 'deb http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/kubic:/libcontainers:/stable/x${NAME}_${VERSION_ID}/ /' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/devel:kubic:libcontainers:stable.list"
wget -nv https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:kubic:libcontainers:stable/x${NAME}_${VERSION_ID}/Release.key -O- | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt update && sudo apt install skopeo
```
